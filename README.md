---

## ⚙️ How to Use Flan-T5

You can use Flan-T5 via **Hugging Face's Transformers library**:

```python
from transformers import T5Tokenizer, T5ForConditionalGeneration

# Load the model and tokenizer
model_name = "google/flan-t5-large"
tokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Define input text
input_text = "Summarize: The history of artificial intelligence is fascinating..."
inputs = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors="pt")

# Generate output
output = model.generate(**inputs)
print(tokenizer.decode(output[0], skip_special_tokens=True))
```
